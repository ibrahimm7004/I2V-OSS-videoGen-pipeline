prompts:
  global_prompt: |-
    Ultra-real prehistoric documentary realism; 16:9; bright clear daytime with high visibility and crisp detail.
    Continuous setting: dense tropical jungle riverbank with shallow water, wet sand, exposed roots, ferns, drifting mist near waterline only.
    Subject: one insanely gigantic Titanoboa, far larger than surrounding trees and river width, charcoal-olive scales with subtle amber iridescence, mud flecks, scar near left jawline; consistent size and anatomy every clip.
    The snake’s body thickness rivals tree trunks; coils displace large volumes of sand and water; scale must feel geologically massive and overwhelming.
    Camera language: natural-history cinematography; stabilized handheld micro-shake; 35mm lens look; realistic depth of field; no stylized grading.
    Lighting: hard sun filtered through canopy; sharp but natural shadows; consistent time of day; consistent color temperature.
    No text anywhere; no subtitles; no captions; no logos; no watermarks; silent video.
  negative_prompt: |-
    Any text, captions, subtitles, watermarks, logos, UI overlays, credits.
    Low-res, blurry, out of focus, excessive motion blur, smeared textures, waxy skin, plastic look.
    Deformed anatomy, extra limbs, duplicated head, broken jaw, melting scales, inconsistent scale pattern.
    Temporal flicker, jitter, sudden teleporting, scene cuts, identity drift, costume drift.
    Cartoon, anime, illustration, painterly, over-saturated, heavy film grain, unrealistic color grading.
    Impossible physics unrelated to scale emphasis, floating objects, warped perspective, stretched bodies, unnatural shadows.
  continuity_rules:
    - "Maintain the same Titanoboa identity every clip: charcoal-olive scales with subtle amber iridescence, scar near left jawline, mud flecks; do not change markings."
    - "The Titanoboa must remain unrealistically gigantic in every shot; body thickness comparable to massive tree trunks; always dwarfing trees and riverbank."
    - "Keep the same continuous riverbank micro-location: shallow water at frame right, wet sand foreground, dense ferns and roots midground; no hard teleports."

    name: "Colossal Emergence"
    prompt: |-
      Titanoboa’s enormous head, larger than a boulder, pushes through towering ferns; a single coil rises higher than nearby trees as it spills onto wet sand.
      Camera: extreme low-angle wide, slow push-in emphasizing the towering vertical height of a raised coil against the canopy.
      Environment: bright sun through canopy, roots appear small compared to the snake’s trunk-like body; river visible frame right.
      Continuity reminder: same scar on left jawline and same gigantic proportions dominating trees and river.
  - index: 1
    name: "Tree-Level Coil"
    prompt: |-
      Continuing, Titanoboa forms a colossal coil that arches above the treeline; its body diameter rivals the thickest jungle trunks.
      Camera: lateral dolly revealing full height of the coil relative to trees; keep scale comparison obvious.
      Environment: ferns and roots look miniature; sand compresses deeply under immense weight.
      Continuity reminder: same Titanoboa markings and extreme size towering over vegetation.
  - index: 2
    name: "River Overshadowed"
    prompt: |-
      From the last frame, Titanoboa stretches across the riverbank; one massive coil spans nearly the full width of the shallow river, casting a long shadow over water.
      Camera: slow pan along the snake’s immense length, ending on the massive head near frame left.
      Environment: water ripples distort under its bulk; trees appear dwarfed.
      Continuity reminder: preserve identical scar and coloration; maintain overwhelming size relative to river and trees.
  - index: 3
    name: "Mountainous Strike"
    prompt: |-
      Titanoboa launches forward; its head surges like a landslide, displacing sand in huge waves; nearby trees bend from the force of motion.
      Camera: dynamic push-in following the gigantic head, framing trees and river to reinforce scale.
      Environment: massive sand plumes and water displacement emphasize weight and mass.
      Continuity reminder: same Titanoboa identity; maintain exaggerated colossal scale against jungle backdrop.
  - index: 4
    name: "Forest-Crushing Drag"
    prompt: |-
      Continuing, Titanoboa drags prey across sand; each coil crushes small trees and roots under its trunk-thick body.
      Camera: low tracking shot showing coils flattening vegetation as they advance.
      Environment: ferns snap and sand trenches form from extreme weight.
      Continuity reminder: same scar and scale pattern; maintain absurdly large proportions dwarfing landscape.
  - index: 5
    name: "Canopy-Level Constriction"
    prompt: |-
      From the last frame, Titanoboa lifts part of its body high; a loop rises to canopy height while tightening around prey below.
      Camera: upward tilt from ground to raised coil towering against sky.
      Environment: bright sky visible between trees; coil silhouette larger than tree crowns.
      Continuity reminder: identical Titanoboa markings; same enormous height relative to trees.
  - index: 6
    name: "Root-Shattering Anchor"
    prompt: |-
      Continuing, Titanoboa braces its tail against a massive root system; the root appears small compared to the snake’s diameter.
      Camera: medium-wide showing tail thickness next to roots for direct scale contrast.
      Environment: sand caves inward under immense pressure; river churns lightly.
      Continuity reminder: keep same Titanoboa scar and exaggerated trunk-like body thickness.
  - index: 7
    name: "Valley-Spanning Reposition"
    prompt: |-
      From the last frame, Titanoboa shifts position; its body arcs across the riverbank like a living bridge, nearly spanning from jungle wall to water’s edge.
      Camera: slow pull-back to reveal the vast horizontal length across frame.
      Environment: trees and shoreline appear miniature beneath the snake’s bulk.
      Continuity reminder: same Titanoboa identity; maintain overwhelming scale dominating entire frame.
  - index: 8
    name: "Colossal S-Curve"
    prompt: |-
      Continuing, Titanoboa settles into an enormous S-curve; each bend as wide as a small hill, shadow stretching across sand and water.
      Camera: wide establishing shot emphasizing landscape dwarfed by the snake.
      Environment: bright midday sun; long, heavy shadow cast by towering coils.
      Continuity reminder: preserve same scar and coloration; keep gigantic proportions unchanged.
  - index: 9
    name: "Titanic Glide"
    prompt: |-
      From the last frame, Titanoboa glides forward parallel to the river; its body undulates like a moving ridge line, filling most of the 16:9 frame.
      Camera: side-follow tracking shot with trees and river clearly smaller in comparison.
      Environment: sand ridges form under its weight; canopy appears low relative to its height.
      Continuity reminder: maintain exact markings and impossibly massive size; same riverbank setting and bright daylight.

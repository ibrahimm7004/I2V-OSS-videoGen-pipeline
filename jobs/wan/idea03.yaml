  global_prompt: "Ultra-real prehistoric documentary realism; 16:9; bright clear daytime\
    \ with high visibility and crisp detail.\nContinuous setting: dense tropical jungle\
    \ riverbank with shallow water, wet sand, exposed roots, ferns, drifting mist\
    \ near waterline only.\nSubject: one insanely gigantic Titanoboa, far larger than\
    \ surrounding trees and river width, charcoal-olive scales with subtle amber iridescence,\
    \ mud flecks, scar near left jawline; consistent size and anatomy every clip.\n\
    The snake\u2019s body thickness rivals tree trunks; coils displace large volumes\
    \ of sand and water; scale must feel geologically massive and overwhelming.\n\
    Camera language: natural-history cinematography; stabilized handheld micro-shake;\
    \ 35mm lens look; realistic depth of field; no stylized grading.\nLighting: hard\
    \ sun filtered through canopy; sharp but natural shadows; consistent time of day;\
    \ consistent color temperature.\nNo text anywhere; no subtitles; no captions;\
    \ no logos; no watermarks; silent video."
  negative_prompt: 'Any text, captions, subtitles, watermarks, logos, UI overlays,
    credits.

    Low-res, blurry, out of focus, excessive motion blur, smeared textures, waxy skin,
    plastic look.

    Deformed anatomy, extra limbs, duplicated head, broken jaw, melting scales, inconsistent
    scale pattern.

    Temporal flicker, jitter, sudden teleporting, scene cuts, identity drift, costume
    drift.

    Cartoon, anime, illustration, painterly, over-saturated, heavy film grain, unrealistic
    color grading.

    Impossible physics unrelated to scale emphasis, floating objects, warped perspective,
    stretched bodies, unnatural shadows.'
  continuity_rules:
  - 'Maintain the same Titanoboa identity every clip: charcoal-olive scales with subtle
    amber iridescence, scar near left jawline, mud flecks; do not change markings.'
  - The Titanoboa must remain unrealistically gigantic in every shot; body thickness
    comparable to massive tree trunks; always dwarfing trees and riverbank.
  - 'Keep the same continuous riverbank micro-location: shallow water at frame right,
    wet sand foreground, dense ferns and roots midground; no hard teleports.'

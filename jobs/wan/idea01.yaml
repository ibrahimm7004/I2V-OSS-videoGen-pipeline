prompts:
  global_prompt: '16:9 cinematic night city in heavy rain; rain-slick asphalt with
    strong neon reflections; shallow depth of field with neon bokeh; steam vents and
    light mist; realistic wet surfaces and specular highlights; consistent color palette:
    teal, magenta, amber; soft filmic contrast; 35mm lens look; subtle handheld micro-shake
    but mostly stabilized; natural motion with believable physics; no text anywhere;
    no subtitles; no logos; no watermarks.

    Identity lock: same main subject across all clips, a woman in her late 20s with
    short black bob hair, light olive skin, small beauty mark under left eye, wearing
    a bright yellow hooded raincoat, black slim pants, white sneakers, holding a clear
    dome umbrella with a thin black handle; same outfit, same face, same umbrella;
    same time of night and same rainy weather.'
  negative_prompt: 'text, captions, subtitles, signage lettering that becomes readable,
    watermarks, logos, UI overlays, credits, QR codes, posters with legible words;

    extra limbs, extra fingers, fused hands, warped face, identity drift, age shift,
    hairstyle change, outfit change, umbrella shape change;

    flicker, jitter, temporal wobble, frame blending, ghosting trails, duplicated
    subject, inconsistent reflections, melting buildings;

    overexposed highlights, crushed blacks, muddy low-light noise, banding, compression
    blocks, extreme motion blur, strobing.'
  continuity_rules:
  - Maintain the same subject identity (face, hair, raincoat, umbrella) and the same
    wet neon street setting across all clips.
  - "Each clip i>0 must begin exactly from the previous clip\u2019s last-frame composition;\
    \ continue direction of movement and camera motion without teleporting."
  - Keep the same night rain lighting and color palette (teal/magenta/amber) with
    consistent lens look and depth of field; no readable text.

  prompt: 'Subject: the woman in the yellow raincoat walks toward camera under a clear
    umbrella, raindrops streaking and beading on the canopy.

    handheld micro-shake.

    Environment/Light: neon-lit wet street with teal and magenta reflections; steam

    ground; rain and mist consistent; no readable signage.
